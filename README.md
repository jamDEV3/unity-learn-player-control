<h1> Unity Learn Tutorial - Player Control </h1>
  
   My attempt at the Unity Learn - Player Control Tutorial:
   https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-1-driving-simulation?pathwayId=5f7e17e1edbc2a5ec21a20af&missionId=5f71fe63edbc2a00200e9de0
  
  - Car game with basic movement (forward/backward movement with steering)
  - Obstacles: Hit boxes and avoid oncoming traffic
  - Camera Toggle (3rd person view behind car / Front of car)

All assets, libraries etc. belong to Unity Technologies and respective owners. This repository is purely for sharing my approach to this project.
